# CarePulse: Reimagining Healthcare Scheduling

Healthcare shouldn't feel like navigating a maze. **CarePulse** is a modern patient management platform that transforms the appointment booking experience from frustrating phone calls and paperwork into a seamless digital journey.

## The Challenge

Every day, healthcare teams lose countless hours to:

- **Manual data entry** across disconnected spreadsheets
- **Phone tag** with patients trying to book appointments
- **Security risks** from sending sensitive information via email
- **No-shows** from poor communication and reminder systems

I built CarePulse to solve these pain points with a modern tech stack that prioritizes both patient experience and administrative efficiency.

## The Solution

**For Patients:**

- 🎯 **Frictionless onboarding** – Simple landing page captures essentials, then guides users through a multi-step registration wizard
- 📄 **Smart document handling** – Secure upload and storage of identity documents and medical records
- 📱 **Real-time updates** – Instant SMS notifications via Twilio for appointment confirmations and changes
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – Built-in consent management and HIPAA-conscious data handling

**For Healthcare Staff:**

- 📊 **Unified dashboard** – Review all appointment requests, patient profiles, and scheduling metrics in one place
- ⚡ **One-click actions** – Approve, reschedule, or cancel appointments with instant patient notification
- 🔍 **Performance monitoring** – Sentry integration tracks errors and bottlenecks in production
- 🚀 **Zero backend maintenance** – Appwrite handles auth, database, and storage infrastructure

## Technical Architecture

The Next.js App Router organizes the experience into three core flows:

### 1. Patient Intake Flow

The landing page renders a clean <InlineCode>PatientForm</InlineCode> that captures essential information. When submitted, the <InlineCode>createUser</InlineCode> server action provisions an Appwrite user account, gracefully handling duplicate email or phone collisions before redirecting to the registration wizard.

### 2. Profile Registration

The registration page hydrates with Appwrite data server-side. If the user already has a patient document, we skip ahead to appointment booking. Otherwise, we render the <InlineCode>RegisterForm</InlineCode> with prefilled data and secure file upload handling backed by Appwrite storage.

### 3. Scheduling & Admin Operations

Patients submit pending appointment requests through <InlineCode>createAppointment</InlineCode>, while admins can confirm or cancel via <InlineCode>updateAppointment</InlineCode>. Both actions live in a centralized module and trigger path revalidation to keep the admin dashboard instantly updated.

  All business logic lives in server actions—no API routes needed. This keeps
  code co-located with UI components while maintaining type safety end-to-end.
</Callout>

## Code Highlights

Server actions keep form submissions clean and type-safe. Here's the appointment creator:

```ts
// lib/actions/appointment.actions.ts
export const createAppointment = async (
  appointment: CreateAppointmentParams
) => {
  const cleanAppointment = {
    userId: appointment.userId,
    client: appointment.patient,
    schedule: appointment.schedule,
    reason: appointment.reason,
    status: appointment.status,
    note: appointment.note || '',
    company: appointment.company || 'Unknown',
  }

  const newAppointment = await databases.createDocument(
    DATABASE_ID!,
    APPOINTMENT_COLLECTION_ID!,
    ID.unique(),
    cleanAppointment
  )

  revalidatePath('/admin')
  return parseStringify(newAppointment)
}
```

The appointment form intelligently handles creation, scheduling, and cancellation with a single component:

```tsx
// components/forms/AppointmentForm.tsx
const onSubmit = async (values: z.infer<typeof AppointmentFormValidation>) => {
  const status =
    type === 'schedule'
      ? 'scheduled'
      : type === 'cancel'
        ? 'cancelled'
        : 'pending'

  if (type === 'create' && patientId) {
    const appointment = {
      userId,
      patient: patientId,
      schedule: new Date(values.schedule),
      reason: values.reason!,
      status: status as Status,
      note: values.note || '',
    }

    const newAppointment = await createAppointment(appointment)
    if (newAppointment) {
      form.reset()
      router.push(
        `/patients/${userId}/new-appointment/success?appointmentId=${newAppointment.$id}`
      )
    }
  } else {
    await updateAppointment({
      userId,
      appointmentId: appointment?.$id!,
      timeZone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
      appointment: {
        schedule: new Date(values.schedule),
        status: status as Status,
        cancellationReason: values.cancellationReason,
      },
      type,
    })
  }
}
```

## Impact & Key Learnings

**What This Project Demonstrates:**

CarePulse proves that modern healthcare software doesn't require massive infrastructure investments. By orchestrating Next.js 14, Appwrite, and Twilio, we built a production-ready patient management system that:

✅ **Eliminates backend complexity** – Server actions replace traditional API routes  
✅ **Scales effortlessly** – Appwrite handles auth, database, and storage without DevOps overhead  
✅ **Maintains type safety** – End-to-end TypeScript from forms to database  
✅ **Delivers real-time UX** – Path revalidation keeps admin dashboards instantly updated

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Server actions are game-changers** for form-heavy applications—no API boilerplate needed
2. **Managed backends like Appwrite** let you ship faster without sacrificing control
3. **SMS notifications** dramatically reduce no-shows and improve patient satisfaction
4. **Modular form architecture** makes adding new workflows trivial

This architecture pattern transfers directly to any intake-driven workflow: legal consultations, service bookings, educational enrollment, or customer onboarding.
